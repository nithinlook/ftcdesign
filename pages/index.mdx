# Welcome to ftcdesign.org
 
ftcdesign.org is an all in one guide and resource to boost the efficiency of FTC OnShape users of all skill levels!
Ignore the dust, we're still under construction :).

# What is ftcdesign.org?

1. ftcdesign.org is a tailored guide which has compiled CAD and Design practices, written specifically for the FTC community
2. We have a competitive focus and most tips / advice are given with that in mind.
3. We teach with the perspective of someone who has not touched CAD before, but then slowly build up from there, this allows students of any caliber to find success!
4. ftcdesign.org is for OnShape and OnShape only.. well at least for now, check back in 10 years and we will finally be covering OffShape.
5. Good design practices are essential to our guides. Despite there being ways to cut corners, we set the designs up for success instead :).
