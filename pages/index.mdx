# Welcome to ftcdesign.org
Ignore the dust, we're still under construction :)\
We will be releasing an invite to our discord server soon with more information on how to contribute, use, and share this resource, but as of now communication is private.

# What is ftcdesign.org?
ftcdesign.org is a resource meant to provide people from any experience level, especially those new to design, all the information they need to make a competitive design for FTC through raising the floor for initial designs with CAD, and teaching the user *how* to iterate quickly and effectively for success in a competition season.\

Furthermore, this resource is only for the CAD software Onshape as it is the most accessible and effective solution for sharing designs in a team (more detailed information coming soon). The learning course focuses largely on building strong skills and workflows with the software to make competitive designs as efficiently as possible.\
