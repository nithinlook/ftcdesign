# Overview
This section is entirely dedicated to **high quality examples** of common mechanisms in FTC. Each section will have an access link to the CAD and some more information highlighting and explaining anything unique!

More information coming on how we will accept contributions to this section soon.

> [!NOTE]

> Not all mechanisms are necessarily *perfect* (in their functionality, workflow used to design the mechanism, or other such things) so be sure to read the write-up below to learn more about what worked and what could be improved on.
