# Overview
Welcome to the learning course, the heart of FTCDesign as of now. Through a set of 4 stages, this resource teaches you all you need to know to dive into designing for FTC and building efficient workflows that scale up to work in a team effectively.

The course is structured in a way that even if you don't know everything there is to designing yet, you are still able to contribute to the team's CAD. Design leads will more closely know their team members' capabilities are based on which stage they are on, and can provide tasks that those members can still accomplish.
