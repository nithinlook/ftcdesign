# Introduction

## What is design?
At the most basic level, design is usually the plan for how the robot is planned out to be built. This could mean the overall archetype of the robot (the general moving components on the robot as a whole, such as a pivoting arm, two sets of linear extensions, or an active intake to shooter), or the little details on which motor/servo is mounted, what materials are used, etc. [add more here]

## What is CAD?
CAD, or Computer Aided Design, is a tool and software used to 3D model parts before they are built/manufactured in real life. There are many different types of CAD software, but this website entirely focuses on Onshape. [add more here]

## Why use Onshape?
VCS (saving work + collaborating), live sharing with others, capable of running on nearly any device
