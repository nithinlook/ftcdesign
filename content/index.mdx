## What is FTCDesign?

FTCDesign is a resource meant to provide people of any experience all the information they need to construct a competitive design for _FIRST® Tech Challenge_ through raising the floor with initial designs in CAD. The main learning course currently primarily targets newer individuals, teaching them how to iterative quickly and effectively for success in a competitive season while improving their initial designs as well.

Furthermore, this resource is only for the online CAD software [Onshape](https://onshape.com/) as it is the most accessible and effective solution for sharing designs as a team. The learning course focuses largely on building strong skills and workflows with this software to make competitive designs as fast as possible.
